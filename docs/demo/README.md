## Why Flutter Instead of Bravo Studio?

During development, we initially planned to use Bravo Studio for the mobile app but encountered several limitations:

### Bravo Studio Limitations:
- **15 Page Limit**: Not sufficient for our complex order management system
- **No Dynamic Content**: Cannot handle real-time order updates or user-generated content
- **Backend Integration Issues**: Very difficult to connect with Express.js and MongoDB
- **Limited Customization**: Couldn't match our design system requirements
- **No Real-time Features**: Essential for order tracking and notifications

### Flutter Advantages:
- **Unlimited Screens**: Complete freedom in app structure and navigation
- **Dynamic Content Support**: Real-time updates, user-generated content, live order tracking
- **Perfect API Integration**: Seamless connection with our Express.js REST API
- **Custom UI/UX**: Exact match with our Figma designs and web app styling
- **Cross-platform**: Single codebase for both iOS and Android
- **Performance**: Native performance and smooth animations

## Recording Guidelines

### For Flutter Mobile Demo:
- Record on actual device (Android/iOS) or emulator
- Show both portrait and landscape orientations
- Demonstrate smooth animations and transitions
- Include real-time features (order updates, notifications)
- Show API integration with live data
- Keep recording under 5 minutes

### For Desktop Demo:
- Record at 1920x1080 resolution
- Show complete user journeys
- Include admin functionality
- Demonstrate responsive design by resizing browser
- Show database operations in real-time
- Keep recording under 10 minutes

## File Formats
- **Format**: MP4
- **Quality**: High quality (1080p recommended)
- **Size**: Try to keep under 100MB per video
- **Audio**: Include if explaining features, otherwise not required
